## Description

This is the first assessment of my Becode Journey.
We were challenged to create a "pixel-perfect" website with a well-thought theme : Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of HTML.
This project hase been done using HTML and CSS on the 22th of January 2021.

## Where to find it

[Here is a link to the github-page where my version is published](https://guillaumelambermont.github.io/TimBernersLeeChallenge/)

## Who worked on the project

I wrote it myself.

## Status

I need to fix two more things:
* h1 does not appear in bold, even though it is specified in CSS
* Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter icons do not appear, even though the link to CDN is made
I'm working on it until deadline.

Thank you for reading this, I take suggestions by pull requests :)
